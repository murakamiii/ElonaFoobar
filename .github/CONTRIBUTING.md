5. Create your working branch from `develop`. Naming conventions are as follows:
  * Prepend `feature/`, `fix/` or `refactor/` to the short summary of your changes. For example,
    - `feature/add-lua-module`
    - `fix/map-tile-glitch`
    - `refactor/remove-global-variables`
6. Work and commit your changes. Small commits are prefered.

  * **Note:** If your changed source code is not formatted consistently, continuous integration will not pass.
8. Update local `develop` again.
9. Rebase: `git checkout YOUR_WORKING_BRANCH && git rebase develop`.
10. Push the working branch to your repo: `git push origin YOUR_WORKING_BRANCH`.

If your changes are big or you need help, you can send a Draft Pull Request.



# Lua API features

1. Create a new file named `module_[ModuleNameInPascalCase].cpp` under `src/elona/lua_env/api/modules`.
2. Add functions inside the appropriate namespace.
  - Add overrides for functions taking `Position` so two `int`s can be passed instead.
3. Set the binding on the correct table in `elona::lua::LuaApi::bind()`.
4. Update `.luacheckrc` with the new table value.
5. Run `make docgen` to generate corresponding LDoc file. (Rust toolchains are required)
6. Add tests inside `tests/lua_api.cpp`.
7. Provide a playtest script demonstrating the API in the pull request.



# Branching rules

We use Git flow. See http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ for details.



# Code style

See [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md).



# Versioning convention

## Application

Ignore Semantic Versioning.


## Built-in mods
